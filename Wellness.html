    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top"><a href="./Content/Spine.html" target="new">Spine</a></td>
      <td>In human anatomy, the spine is a column usually consisting of 24 articulating vertebrae and 9 fused vertebrae in the sacrum and the coccyx. It is situated in the dorsal aspect of the torso, separated by intervertebral discs. It houses and protects the spinal cord in its spinal canal.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top"><a href="./Content/Ankle.html" target="new">Ankle</a></td>
      <td>The ankle joint is formed where the foot and the leg meet. The ankle, or talocrural joint, is a synovial hinge joint that connects the distal ends of the tibia and fibula in the lower limb with the proximal end of the talus bone in the foot. The articulation between the tibia and the talus bears more weight than between the smaller fibula and the talus.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top"><a href="./Content/Elbow.html" target="new">Elbow</a></td>
      <td>The human elbow is the region surrounding the elbow-jointâ€”the ginglymus or hinge joint in the middle of the arm. Three bones form the elbow joint: the humerus of the upper arm, and the paired radius and ulna of the forearm.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top"><a href="./Content/Knee.html" target="new">Knee</a></td>
      <td>The knee joint joins the thigh with the leg and consists of two articulations: one between the fibula and tibia, and one between the femur and patella. It is the largest joint in the human body and is very complicated. The knee is a mobile trocho-ginglymus (i.e. a pivotal hinge joint), which permits flexion and extension as well as a slight medial and lateral rotation. Since in humans the knee supports nearly the whole weight of the body, it is vulnerable to both acute injury and the development of osteoarthritis.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top"><a href="./Content/Wrist.html" target="new">Wrist</a></td>
      <td>The wrist is variously defined as 1) the carpus or carpal bones, the complex of eight bones forming the proximal skeletal segment of the hand; (2) the wrist joint or radiocarpal joint, the joint between the radius and the carpus; and (3) the anatomical region surrounding the carpus including the distal parts of the bones of the forearm and the proximal parts of the metacarpus or five metacarpal bones and the series of joints between these bones, thus referred to as wrist joints. This region also includes the carpal tunnel, the anatomical snuff box, the flexor retinaculum, and the extensor retinaculum.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top"><a href="./Content/Shoulders.html" target="new">Shoulders</a></td>
      <td>The human shoulder is made up of three bones: the clavicle (collarbone), the scapula (shoulder blade), and the humerus (upper arm bone) as well as associated muscles, ligaments and tendons. The articulations between the bones of the shoulder make up the shoulder joints. The major joint of the shoulder is the glenohumeral joint, which "shoulder joint" generally refers to. In human anatomy, the shoulder joint comprises the part of the body where the humerus attaches to the scapula, the head sitting in the glenoid fossa. The shoulder is the group of structures in the region of the joint.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top"><a href="./Content/Neck.html" target="new">Neck</a></td>
      <td>The neck is the part of the body, on many terrestrial or secondarily aquatic vertebrates, that distinguishes the head from the torso or trunk. The adjective (from Latin) signifying "of the neck" is cervical (though this more frequently used to describe the cervix).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top"><a href="./Content/Hip.html" target="new">Hips</a></td>
      <td>In vertebrate anatomy, hip (or "coxa" in medical terminology) refer to either an anatomical region or a joint.The hip region is located lateral to the gluteal region (i.e. the buttock), inferior to the iliac crest, and overlying the greater trochanter of the femur, or "thigh bone". In adults, three of the bones of the pelvis have fused into the hip bone which forms part of the hip region.</td>
