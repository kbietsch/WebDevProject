      <th scope="row"><a href="Chiropractic Manipulation.html">Chiropractic Manipulation</a></th>
      <td>The most common therapeutic procedure performed by doctors of chiropractic is known as "spinal manipulation," also called "chiropractic adjustment." The purpose of manipulation is to restore joint mobility by manually applying a controlled force into joints that have become hypomobile – or restricted in their movement – as a result of a tissue injury.</td>

      <th scope="row"><a href="Ultrasound Therapy.html">Ultrasound Therapy</a></th>
      <td>Ultrasound therapy can be useful for many different patients. The 'micro-massage' that ultrasound creates can help reduce swelling, increase blood flow, and decrease pain, stiffness, and spasms, making it a viable therapy for numerous applications.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row"><a href="Eletrical Muscle Stimulation.html">Eletrical Muscle Stimulation</a></th>
      <td>Electrical Muscle Stimulation is the use of a high-voltage electric stimulator to treat muscle spasms, edema of acute injury, myofascial pain and certain other disorders. It is a method of pain control by the application of electric impulses to the nerve endings.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row"><a href="Cryotherapy.html">Cryotherapy</a></th>
      <td>Cryotherapy is an excellent way to help with muscle spasms in the body. This therapy is well known to help numb painful areas as well as provide a cooling relief to affected soft tissues. The therapy consists of applying cold compresses on to the skin to effectively reduce the temperature of the skin as well as constrict the blood vessels in the area.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row"><a href="X-ray.html">X-Ray</a></th>
      <td>Radiographs or x-rays are used to see the bones. X-rays do not detect soft tissue abnormalities like torn ligaments or strained muscles. However, they are a valuable source of information and helps the doctor to determine important information such as misalignments of the bones, possible fractures or breaks, as well as the level of current degeneration of your joints.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row"><a href="Subluxation Treatment.html">Subluxation Treatment</a></th>
      <td>Life experiences of all kinds impose forces of movement that often move one or more vertebrae away from this ideal, centered alignment. This misalignment of one vertebrae in relation to the next is called a subluxation. A subluxation can cause pain, because when the bones move they press on nerves that exit out holes provided by the interface between two adjacent vertebrae.</td>
