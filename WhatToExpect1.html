        <br />
        <h2> Examination</h2><hr />
     <p> In many regards, a chiropractic examination is very similar to standard examination procedures administered by all health care providers. With that said, how chiropractors examine the structure and function of the spine and then determine specific chiropractic treatments separate chiropractic care from other disciplines.
An initial chiropractic exam for back pain will typically have three parts: a consultation, case history, and physical examination. Following the consultation and case history, a physical examination that will include x-ray examination and will be performed in accordance with the chiropractor's clinical judgment.</p><br />
     
     <h2>X-Ray Studies</h2><hr />
     <p>Your specific condition will require us to take x-rays to get a full evaluation of a patient. X-rays help us rule out more serious conditions or assist us in developing the most effective treatment plan for you. Most people are amazed once they see their x-rays and can often immediately identify their misalignments and degeneration themselves. Once the x-rays have been taken we will schedule you for your follow-up visit.</p><br />
                
        <h2>Report Findings</h2><hr />
            <p>After discussing with you your medical history, examining of your spine and reviewing any x-rays or tests, Dr. Rickey Allen will discuss what treatment is best for you. If you have a condition that requires care with other providers, the doctor will tell you.</p><br />
