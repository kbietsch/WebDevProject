    	  <div class="contentText"><!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="body" -->Chiropractic treatment is very effective for many of the problems that cause knee pain and although a condition such as osteoarthritis is not curable, the symptoms can be reduced and the progression of the problem can be helped thanks to our unique approach to treatment.<br /><br />

If knee pain is limiting your day-to-day or sporting activities, if you have been given painkillers and been told to rest with no long-term improvement, or you have been told you have arthritis and there is nothing that can be done?<br /><br />

Then chiropractic treatment may well be the answer.<br /><br />

<h2>The Knee Joint</h2><br />

The knee is a complex joint that relies heavily on ligaments and muscles for stability.The knee is a major weight bearing joint and is composed of:<br /><br />

The tibio-femoral joint (between the thigh and lower leg).<br /><br />

The patello-femoral joint (between the knee cap and the thigh.<br /><br />

Muscles and ligaments, which gives active and passive stability to the knee.<br /><br />

Two ring shaped cartilage discs in the knee, called the menisci (one meniscus).<br /><br />

<h2>Chiropractic treatment of knee pain</h2><br />

We have outlined the process of our treatment below to give you an idea of our approach. We would normally modify the treatment to suit each patient and their specific conditions. So the type of treatment that is most appropriate for one person is not necessarily right for another.<br /><br />

<h2>Stage 1: Reduce joint inflammation and reduce pain.</h2><br />

How?<br /><br />

Avoidance of aggravating factors, use of a support, sports tape<br /><br />

Ice to reduce inflammation, muscle spasm and pain<br /><br />

Soft tissue healing: laser, ultrasound and interferential therapy<br /><br />

<h2>Stage 2: Normalise joint function</h2><br />

How?<br />

Specific chiropractic manipulation and mobilisation techniques to areas of restricted movement in the knee and surrounding joints, to increase movement, improve the function and reduce pain<br /><br />

Deep soft tissue massage, trigger-point therapy and cross-friction.<br /><br />

<h2>Stage 3: Rehabilitation exercise program.</h2><br />

When appropriate we introduce exercises to improve strength, endurance and stability. We also work on improving your balance and your sense of joint position (proprioception). This will help you to return to normal and also prevent new injuries.<br /><br /><!-- InstanceEndEditable -->
